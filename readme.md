##BrowserBattleship

This is an in-browser implementation of the classic BattleShip game.
Uses extensive manipulation of the dom to create, populate, and maintain grid cells,
and regex functions to parse various valid user input formats.

###Future Functionality
I plan to add additional functionality that:
-Moves user alert info to display on the page itself in lieu of js alerts.
-Update the regex input function to check and allow for additional types of user input for ship placement

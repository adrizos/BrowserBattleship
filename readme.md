## BrowserBattleship

This is an in-browser implementation of the classic BattleShip game.
Uses extensive manipulation of the DOM to create, populate, and maintain grid cells,
and regex functions to parse various valid user input formats.

### Future Functionality
I plan to add additional functionality that:
- Moves user alert info to display on the page itself in lieu of js alerts.
- Update the regex input function to check and allow for additional types of user input for ship placement
- Fix the score keeping function to keep track of top ten scores indefinitely
